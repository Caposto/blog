# Personal Portfolio Website/Blog
This project was built in Flask and serves as an attempt at a portfolio website/blog.

In this project the Notion API functions as a Content-Management-System (CMS) for blog posts. The flask app parses blog properties from a notion database and uses them to display and link a blog post on the site.
